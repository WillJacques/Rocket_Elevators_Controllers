To run JavaScript with HTML interface, download in same folder :

1-Residential_Controller.html

2-Residential_Controller.js

Then open Residential_Controller.html

Press a scenario Button and look at Console.

---------------

All programs (JavaScript, Python, Ruby) have a list of prefilled scenarios functions to uncomment to run them.

JavaScript can be run on HTML with browser console, or run on Windows console.
Python and Ruby can only be run on a Windows console.

There are 0.5 seconds sleep time between actions in each programs so be aware to remove them if you want the program to run instantly :)

Thank you !

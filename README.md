New files added to repo !

All 4 files are ready to launch scenario #4 ! Just to put it in comment and uncomment other one to run them ! 

There are sleep delay in C#, Java et Go so be aware to remove them before start if you don't want to wait !

Commercial_Controller.ex ->   in Elixir, not completed but it can run the scenarios with some hardcoding already prefilled for each scenarios !
Commercial_Controller.go ->   in Golang
Commercial_Controller.java -> in Java
Commercial_Controller.cs ->   in C#

---------------

To run JavaScript with HTML interface, download in same folder :

1-Residential_Controller.html

2-Residential_Controller.js

Then open Residential_Controller.html

Press a scenario Button and look at Console.

---------------

All programs (JavaScript, Python, Ruby) have a list of prefilled scenarios functions to uncomment to run them.

JavaScript can be run on HTML with browser console, or run on Windows console.
Python and Ruby can only be run on a Windows console.

There are 0.5 seconds sleep time between actions in each programs so be aware to remove them if you want the program to run instantly :)

Thank you !
